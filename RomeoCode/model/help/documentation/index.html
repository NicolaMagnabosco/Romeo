					<h2>How to read this manual</h2>
					<p>This manual will guide you through the execution of the steps that will bring you
						to know and use the features of Romeo, at best. 
					</p>
					<p>The document is divided in four
						principal sections:
						<ul>
							<li>Getting started: which will provide you the instructions to install and unin-
								stall the software. It also gives you an overview of the main window of Romeo;</li>
							<li>Set up analysis: which will guide you through the execution of the necessary
								steps, that allow you to perform an analysis;</li>
							<li>Execution of an analysis: which will provide you the instructions to manage
								and execute an analysis;</li>
							<li>Visualization and exportation of results: which will guide you through
								the management of the results obtained from the analysis.</li>
						</ul>

					<h2>Overview</h2>
					<p>
					Romeo is an open source tool that can provide the application of cluster analysis to biomedical data.
					Furthermore, it is possible to extracts some features of interest from the images and combine
					them before performing clustering.
					This technique is used to automate and facilitate the delineation of anatomical structures and
					other regions of interest, in medical images.
					The procedure, can accelerate the processing
					speed and accuracy of the diagnosis, allowing to locate pathological tissues and measure
					tissue volumes. It has thus great potential for prevention, prognosis, and treatment.

					<h3>Why Romeo?</h3>
					<ul>
					<li> Intuitive User Interface Romeo has an intuitive Grafic User Interface that allows it to be used by expert and not expert ICT users;</li>
					<li> Various cluster algorithms Romeo is the only stand-alone software that integrates three types of Cluster Algorithms by default. In fact, it implements: K-means, Fuzzy C means and Hierarchical algorithms;</li>
					<li> Supports major data formats This tool can work with 2D, 3D, 2D-t and 3D-t images and supports these file formats: .PNG, .JPG, .BPM, .AVI, NIfTI and Analyze 7.5;</li>
					<li> Various feature extractors Romeo implements fifteen different Feature Extractors;</li>
					<li> Independence from file-system Once Romeo has imported data, the user has the freedom to change the location of the imported images in its file-system. In fact, the software saves the images inside itself. Once the user wants to export some image results, Romeo asks the path where the files have to be saved.</li>					
					</ul>

					<h2>Romeo Features</h2>
					<ul>
						<li>
							Apply mask Enables users to import a mask and associate it to another image. 
							That mask, works like a filter of interest on the imported image; in other words, it delimits the region
							which will be analyzed;
						</li>
						<li>
							Create groups of Subjects Enables users to create customized sets of Subjects (an image plus its mask), allowing to perform the algorithms on different images simultaneously;
						</li>
						<li>
							Create Protocols Enable users to create customized Protocols (a set of Feature Extractors plus one o none cluster algorithm. Each algorithm can be customized with its own parameters (like window size, GLCM etc. . . );
						</li>
						<li>
							Create Dataset Enables users to create a customized analysis, formed by a group of Subjects and
							one or more Protocols. The Dataset also memorize the results of the analysis and permits the user to export them;
						</li>
						<li>
							Possibility of extension with other algorithms Enables developers to extend the set of feature extractors and cluster algorithms with
							new ones, compatible with supported format Files.

			<h1>Main Window</h1>
			<div style="text-align:center">
				<a name="fig2"><img src="images/MainWindow.png"/></a>
			</div>
			<p>The Romeo main window includes two major panels. As you can see in <a href="#fig2">Fig. 2</a>, the left panel
			contains a set of buttons, which will allow you to enter the windows that create and manage
			the entities of the software (Subjects , group of Subjects, Protocols and Datasets ).
			The right panel, contains the Analysis section wich includes two buttons that will bring
			you respectively to the analysis execution window and the results visualization window.
			The More Help section, instead, includes the links to access the informative materials of
			the software:
