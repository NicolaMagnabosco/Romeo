				The execution of an analysis is assigned to the analysis window.
				From the main window of Romeo, select the Start Analysis button or choose the right one
				in the toolbar. The analysis window <a href="#fig15">(Fig. 15)</a>, is composed of two panels. The left
				one contains a drop-down menu, that allow the user to select the Dataset of interest. The
				right one contains an area in which Romeo will show the feature extractors associated with
				the selected Dataset . The user can choose which results of the extraction will be saved
				and/or shown during the analysis, checking the feature extractors of interest shown in the
				right panel.
			</p>
