				The creation of a new Protocol is assigned to the Protocol creation window.
				From the main window of Romeo, select the New Protocol button or choose the right one in
				the toolbar. The Protocol creation window <a href="#fig9">(Fig. 9)</a> is composed of three panels.
				The left one contains information about the Protocol that is going to be created (Name
				and Type). The center panel eventually contains a list of feature extractors that the user
				has associate to the Protocol . Above that list there are the Add Feature and the Remove
				Selected buttons. The right one contains the drop-down menu to select the cluster algorithm.
				In any moment, the user can go back to the main window by selecting the Back button. To
				create a new Protocol , follow these instructions:
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>
					From the Protocol creation window, type a unique name in the Name field. That
					name will be the name of the Protocol ;
				</li>
				<li>
					Select the type of the Subjects on which the Protocol will perform from the Type
					drop-down menu;
				</li>
				<li>
					To add some feature extractors in the Protocol , select the Add Feature button,
					and follow these instructions  <a href="#fig10">(Fig. 10)</a> :
					<ul>
						<li>From the feature selector dialog window, select the feature extractor to include
							from the drop-down menu. Romeo will show the parameters that have to be
							setted;
						</li>
						<li>
							Type the necessary parameters for the selected feature or leave the default ones;
						</li>
						<li>
							Select the Ok button to confirm the selection.
						</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>
					To add a cluster algorithm into the Protocol , select it from the drop-down menu on
					the right panel of the window and then set the relative parameters;					
				</li>
				<li>
					Select the Save button to confirm the operation. Romeo will report an error message if
					the name chosen for the Protocol is already present in Romeo or not all the required
					fields are properly completed.
